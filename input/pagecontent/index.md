### Background
This guide serves as a repository of FHIR-to-OMOP and OMOP-to-FHIR information.

### Use Cases
The initial use case is querying a FHIR-enabled data repository to retrieve records and load them into an OMOP data store.  The guide defines a set of logical models that represent the OMOP Common Data Model, v5.4.  It also provides mappings, defined as FHIR StructureMaps and ConceptMaps, between the International Patient Access FHIR profiles and the OMOP data tables.
